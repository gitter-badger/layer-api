A .NET portable library, which provides a wrapper for the [Layer](https://layer.com) Platform API.

The Layer Platform API is designed to empower developers to automate, extend, and integrate functionality provided by the Layer platform with other services and applications.

This library now supports requests from your **servers** only.
